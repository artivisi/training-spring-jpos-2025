  Echo/Heartbeat Service
  Sends periodic echo messages (0800/301) to keep connection alive and detect problems proactively.

  According to jPOS best practices:
  - Send echo every 3 minutes (180000 ms) during idle periods
  - This prevents socket timeout (set to 5 minutes)
  - Allows detection of connection problems before real transactions fail

  Processing:
  - Only sends echo if MUX is connected AND terminal is signed on
  - Logs warnings if echo fails (connection problems)
  - Automatically recovers from errors
